Welcome to my Fashion **MNIST Image Classifier** project, where Machine Learning meets Mobile App Development! 

🌟 In this repository, I’ve built an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras, trained it on the Fashion MNIST dataset, and deployed it as a mobile-friendly model with TensorFlow Lite. But here's the exciting part—I’ll be integrating this model with a Flutter app! 🎉

**🚀 Project Overview**

This project combines my 1.5 years of Flutter development experience and my new passion for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Using the Fashion MNIST dataset, the model can classify fashion items into 10 categories like T-shirts, trousers, sneakers, and more. 👕👖👟

**What’s Inside:**

**🧠 Model Creation:** Built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify grayscale fashion images.

**📊 Training & Evaluation: **Trained on 60,000 images and evaluated on 10,000 test images with impressive accuracy.

**🔧 Deployment:** The model was optimized and converted to TensorFlow Lite for smooth integration into mobile apps.

**🌐 Flutter Integration (coming soon):** I'll be connecting this model to a Flutter mobile app to make on-device predictions and showcase real-time classification!

**🔥 Why This Project is Special:**

Having spent 1.5 years as a Flutter mobile developer, I'm now combining my expertise in mobile development with my journey into Machine Learning. As a graduate student in Computer Science at Chungbuk National University (CBNU), this project is an amazing way to merge my previous skills with new ones. It’s all about leveraging the power of ML/DL with the flexibility of Flutter to create an interactive, intelligent mobile application. 📲✨
